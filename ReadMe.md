![Biomatic biome identifier - V 1.3 for KSP 1.2](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/80379-12-biomatic-biome-sensor)





The Biomatic sensor identifies the biome that the ship is in / above, and shows the information in a small text window. Optionally the ship's situation (high / low space, high / low flight, landed, splashed) can be shown as well. Biomes where science has been done can be added to a list, which is used together with a kill warp option to de-warp the ship when entering an un-listed biome. The list of biomes can be per-vessel, or global.

It is integrated with the stock toolbar by default, but can be configured to use blizzy's. (Change 'stock' to 'blizzy' in the config file).

The Biomatic Part

The Biomatic part is found under the science tab. In career or science mode, it is found in the 'Space Exploration' node of the tech tree - this must be researched before Biomatic will work, either as a part or as a Module Manager add-on to command pods.

ModuleManager will add Biomatic to any command module or probe core, so the separate part does not have to be used.

Download

The Biomatic folder needs to be unzipped and put in your KSP\GameData folder:
