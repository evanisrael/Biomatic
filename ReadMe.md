The Biomatic sensor identifies the biome that the ship is in / above, and shows the information in a small text window. Optionally the ship's situation (high / low space, high / low flight, landed, splashed) can be shown as well. Biomes where science has been done can be added to a list, which is used together with a kill warp option to de-warp the ship when entering an un-listed biome. The list of biomes can be per-vessel, or global.

It is integrated with the stock toolbar by default, but can be configured to use blizzy's. (Change 'stock' to 'blizzy' in the config file).

## The Biomatic Part

The Biomatic part is found under the science tab. In career or science mode, it is found in the 'Space Exploration' node of the tech tree - this must be researched before Biomatic will work, either as a part or as a Module Manager add-on to command pods.

## Module Manager Patch(es)
- adds Biomatic to any command module or probe core
- [OPTIONAL] makes Start the techRequired for the Biomatic part

### 

### Installation 

The Biomatic folder needs to be unzipped and put in your KSP\GameData folder:

### Feedback

Any comments and suggestions for improvements are welcome, as are reports of bugs / problems - please let me know what you think.

### Code


- Window now disappears with the rest of the UI on F2
- If the part config file is edited to move the part to a different tech tree node, it will now behave sensibly rather than requiring 'spaceExploration' to be unlocked


UPDATED (2016-05-02), v1.1.0.1

- If Module Manager is used to add Biomatic functionality to command pods and probe cores, Biomatic is still unavailable until it has been researched
- New look for stock buttons
- Recompiled with KSP 1.1.2 binaries.
